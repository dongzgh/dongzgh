There are several tools available for comparing two folders on a MacBook. These tools allow you to visually or programmatically compare the contents of directories, including files and subdirectories. Here are some of the best options:

## 1. **Built-in Options**

- **Terminal with `diff` Command:**
  - The `diff` command can compare folders in the terminal. Use the `-r` option for recursive comparison:

    ```bash
    diff -rq folder1 folder2
    ```

  - Pros: No additional installation required.
  - Cons: Less user-friendly; suitable for text-based comparisons.

- **FileMerge (Part of Xcode Tools):**
  - FileMerge is a graphical diff tool included with Xcode.
  - Steps:
       1. Install Xcode from the App Store if not already installed.
       2. Launch FileMerge from the command line using:

          ```bash
          opendiff folder1 folder2
          ```

    - Pros: Graphical interface and free with Xcode.
