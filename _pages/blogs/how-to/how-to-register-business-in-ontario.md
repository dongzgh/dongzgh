## 2. Where to Register Business

### 2.1. Government Website

Registering your business directly on the government’s website is generally the best option.

1. **Cost-Effective**: Registering directly through the [Ontario Business Registry](https://www.ontario.ca/page/ontario-business-registry) is usually cheaper since you avoid additional fees charged by third-party services.
2. **Security**: The government's website is secure and ensures your personal and business information is protected.
3. **Accuracy**: Registering directly helps ensure that your information is accurately recorded and processed without any intermediaries.
4. **Support**: You can access official support and resources directly from the government if you encounter any issues during the registration process.

### 2.2. Third Party Services

Third-party services might appear cheaper initially because they often advertise lower base fees, but there are a few factors to consider:

1. **Bundled Services**: Third-party providers often bundle additional services like business name searches, legal advice, or ongoing compliance support, which can make their base registration fee seem lower. However, these additional services might come with extra costs later on.
2. **Promotional Pricing**: Some third-party services use promotional pricing to attract new customers. These promotions might offer a lower initial cost but could include higher renewal fees or additional charges for essential services².
3. **Hidden Fees**: Be cautious of hidden fees that might not be immediately apparent. While the base fee might be lower, there could be extra charges for things like document filing, expedited processing, or customer support².
4. **Volume Discounts**: Some third-party services can offer lower prices due to the high volume of registrations they handle, allowing them to spread their costs over many customers¹.

## 3. Business Development Strategy

### 3.1. Start Small

For a small online web app business, you might want to consider starting as a **sole proprietorship** or a **general partnership**. Starting as a sole proprietorship or general partnership allows you to test your business idea with minimal risk and cost. As your business grows, you can consider transitioning to a **corporation** to benefit from limited liability and better growth potential.

### 3.2. Scale Up

1. **Register the Corporation**:
   - Choose a unique name for your corporation.
   - File the Articles of Incorporation with the Ontario government.
   - Pay the incorporation fee (typically $300).

2. **Obtain a Business Number (BN)**:
   - If you don’t already have one, you’ll need to get a new Business Number from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) for your corporation.

3. **Transfer Assets and Liabilities**:
   - Transfer the assets and liabilities of your sole proprietorship to the new corporation. This may involve drafting a transfer agreement.

4. **Update Licenses and Permits**:
   - Update any business licenses and permits to reflect the new corporate structure.

5. **Notify Stakeholders**:
   - Inform your clients, suppliers, and other stakeholders about the change in business structure.

6. **Close the Sole Proprietorship**:
   - Cancel the registration of your sole proprietorship with the Ontario Business Registry.

### 3.3. Pros of Incorporating Later

- **Limited Liability**: Protects your personal assets from business liabilities.
- **Tax Benefits**: Potential for tax advantages and deferral.
- **Growth Potential**: Easier to raise capital and expand.

### 3.4. Cons of Incorporating Later

- **Costs**: Additional costs for incorporation and legal fees.
- **Complexity**: More paperwork and regulatory requirements.
- **Transition**: The process of transferring assets and liabilities can be complex.

## 4. How to File Tax for Sole Proprietorship

As a sole proprietor in Ontario, you report your business income and expenses on your personal income tax return. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you through the process:

### 4.1. Gather Your Financial Records

Collect all your business-related financial records, including income, expenses, receipts, and invoices.

### 4.2. Complete Form T2125

Fill out the **Statement of Business or Professional Activities (Form T2125)**. This form is used to report your business income and expenses. You’ll need to provide details such as:

- Business name and address
- Business income
- Business expenses (e.g., office supplies, advertising, travel)

### 4.3. Calculate Net Income

Subtract your total business expenses from your total business income to determine your net income. This net income is what you’ll report on your personal tax return.

### 4.4. File Your T1 Income Tax Return

Include the completed Form T2125 with your T1 General Income Tax and Benefit Return. Report your net business income on line 13500 of your T1 return.

### 4.5. Pay Taxes and CPP Contributions

As a sole proprietor, you may need to make quarterly tax installments if you expect to owe more than $3,000 in taxes. Additionally, you’ll need to pay Canada Pension Plan (CPP) contributions on your business income.

### 4.6. Keep Detailed Records

Maintain detailed records of your business income and expenses for at least six years, as the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) may request to review them.

## 5. How to File Tax for No-Income Business

If your business does not generate income for a couple of years, it can still affect your tax return in several ways:

### 5.1. Claiming Business Expenses

Even without income, you can still claim business expenses on your tax return. These expenses can create a business loss, which can offset other income (like employment or investment income) and reduce your overall tax liability¹².

### 5.2. Carrying Forward Losses

If your business expenses exceed your other income, you may have a net operating loss (NOL). In Canada, you can carry forward these losses to future tax years to offset future income, potentially reducing your tax liability in those years¹.

### 5.3. Filing Requirements

You are still required to file a tax return for your business, even if it has no income. This ensures that you can claim your expenses and carry forward any losses².

### 5.4. CRA Scrutiny

If your business consistently reports losses without generating income, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) might scrutinize your business to determine if it is a legitimate business or a hobby. To be considered a business, you must demonstrate a reasonable expectation of profit².

### 5.5. Impact on Personal Finances

While business losses can reduce your taxable income, they might also impact your personal finances. Continuous losses could affect your ability to secure loans or credit, as lenders may view your business as high-risk.
