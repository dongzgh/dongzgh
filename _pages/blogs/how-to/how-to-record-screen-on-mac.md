To record your screen and audio on a MacBook, you can use either **QuickTime Player** (which is built-in) or **third-party apps** for more advanced features. Here’s how to do it with both options:

## 1. Using QuickTime Player (Built-In Method)

QuickTime Player offers basic screen recording on macOS, and you can capture audio from your Mac's microphone.

### Steps

1. **Open QuickTime Player** from the Applications folder.
2. Click **File** > **New Screen Recording**.
3. In the Screen Recording window, click the **downward arrow** next to the record button to select audio input:
   - **Internal Microphone** for capturing audio from your Mac’s microphone.
4. **Select Recording Area**:
   - You can record the entire screen or a selected portion.
5. **Click the Record Button** to start recording.
6. **Stop Recording**:
   - To stop recording, click the **Stop** button in the menu bar or press `Command + Control + Esc`.

### Note

QuickTime only supports **microphone input** for audio recording, so if you want to capture system audio (the audio coming from your Mac), you’ll need additional software like **BlackHole** or **Loopback**.

## 2. Using Third-Party Apps

For more flexibility and the ability to capture system audio, third-party apps are often more versatile.

### Recommended Apps

- **OBS Studio** (Free):
  - Great for advanced screen recording and live streaming.
  - Supports multiple audio sources, including system audio.
- **ScreenFlow** (Paid):
  - Professional-grade recording and editing tool.
  - Can capture both system audio and microphone audio.
- **Camtasia** (Paid):
  - Comprehensive screen recording and video editing features.
  - Can record system and microphone audio.

### Steps for OBS Studio

1. **Download and install OBS Studio**.
2. **Add a Source**:
   - Click the **+** under "Sources" and select **Display Capture** for screen recording.
3. **Set Up Audio Sources**:
   - Under "Sources," add **Audio Input Capture** for the microphone.
   - For system audio, you may need to install a virtual audio device like **BlackHole**.
4. **Start Recording**:
   - Click **Start Recording** to begin, and **Stop Recording** when finished.

## 3. Using macOS Screenshot Toolbar (macOS Mojave or Later)

The macOS Screenshot toolbar is a quick way to record your screen without opening QuickTime.

1. Press **Command + Shift + 5** to open the toolbar.
2. Select either **Record Entire Screen** or **Record Selected Portion**.
3. Click **Options** to choose audio input, if available.
4. Click **Record** to start and the **Stop** icon in the menu bar to end the recording.

Choose the option that fits your needs best! If you need any other help, just let me know.
