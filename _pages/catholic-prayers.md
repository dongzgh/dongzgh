## The Lordâ€™s Prayer

Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name;  
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven;  
Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us;  and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.  
Amen

## Hail Mary

Hail, Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee;  
Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus;  
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners,  
now and at the hour of our death.  
Amen
