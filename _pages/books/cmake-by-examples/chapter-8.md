Generator expressions in CMake provide a way to customize build configurations and settings based on the build system generator. They are used within CMake commands and properties to conditionally specify values based on the generator in use. Here are some examples of how to use generator expressions:

- Example 1: Setting Compiler Flags Conditionally

  ```cmake
  # Set different compiler flags based on the generator
  target_compile_options(MyTarget PRIVATE
      $<$<CXX_COMPILER_ID:MSVC>:/W4>
      $<$<CXX_COMPILER_ID:GNU>:-Wall>
      $<$<CXX_COMPILER_ID:Clang>:-Wall>
  )
  ```

In this example, the `target_compile_options` command sets different compiler warning flags based on the compiler in use. For MSVC, it sets `/W4`; for GCC and Clang, it sets `-Wall`.

- Example 2: Conditionally Linking Libraries

  ```cmake
  # Link different libraries based on the generator
  target_link_libraries(MyTarget PRIVATE
      $<$<CONFIG:Debug>:debug_library>
      $<$<CONFIG:Release>:optimized release_library>
  )
  ```

Here, the `target_link_libraries` command conditionally links different libraries based on the build configuration. For the Debug configuration, it links `debug_library`; for the Release configuration, it links the optimized version of `release_library`.

- Example 3: Adding Compile Definitions Conditionally

  ```cmake
  # Add compile definitions based on the generator
  target_compile_definitions(MyTarget PRIVATE
      $<$<CONFIG:Debug>:DEBUG_MODE>
      $<$<CONFIG:Release>:RELEASE_MODE>
  )
  ```

In this example, the `target_compile_definitions` command adds compile definitions based on the build configuration. For the Debug configuration, it adds `DEBUG_MODE`; for the Release configuration, it adds `RELEASE_MODE`.

- Example 4: Configuring Output Paths Conditionally

  ```cmake
  # Configure output paths based on the generator
  set_target_properties(MyTarget PROPERTIES
      RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY $<$<CONFIG:Debug>:${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/bin/debug>
      RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY $<$<CONFIG:Release>:${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/bin/release>
  )
  ```

Here, the `set_target_properties` command configures different output paths based on the build configuration. For the Debug configuration, it sets the output directory to `${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/bin/debug`; for the Release configuration, it sets it to `${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/bin/release`.

These examples demonstrate how generator expressions can be used to conditionally set values based on the build system generator or build configuration in CMake. They provide flexibility in configuring different aspects of the build depending on the context.
