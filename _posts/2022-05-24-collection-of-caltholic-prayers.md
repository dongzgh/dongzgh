## Family

- > God, Our Father, loving and merciful, bring together and keep all families in perfect unity of love and mutual support. Instill in each member the spirit of understanding and affection for each other. Keep quarrels and bitterness far from them, and for their occasional failures instill forgiveness and peace.May the mutual love and affection of parents set a good example. Instill in children self-respect that they may respect others and grow in mature independence. May the mutual affection and respect of families be a sign of Christian life here and hereafter, through Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. Amen. **[#2638b9]**{:.citation}
