## [Doing Math with Your Child K-6](http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/literacynumeracy/parentGuideNumEn.pdf)

### Note to Parents

* Using home language to teach is encouraged
* 5 strands to teach:
  * Number Sense and Numeration
  * Measurement
  * Geometry and Spatial Sense
  * Patterning and Algebra
  * Data Management and Probability
* [Ontario math curriculum guidebook](http://edu.gov.on.ca/eng/curriculum/elementary/math18curr.pdf)

### Some Fun Family Learning Experiences

#### Number Sense and Numeration

* Counting
  * Sequential (e.g., 1, 2, 3,...)
  * Mixed up (e.g., 5, 6, 7,...,11, 12,...)
  * Skip in pattern (e.g., 1, 3, 5,...)
  * Count down numbers (e.g., hide and seek)
  * [Bowl them over while learning math facts](https://www.weareteachers.com/active-math-games/)
* Symbols
  * Number symbol hunt
* Fraction
  * Split and sum up
  * Guess number
    * Your child now tries to guess your number by asking questions to which you can give only a yes or a no response. For example, “Is the number between 2 and 4?” “Is the number greater than 3.5?” Continue until your child guesses the number you have picked and writes your number on the number line where it belongs.
* Calculation
  * High number
    * Shuffle or mix up the cards and then leave them face down in a pile. Each player takes two cards and adds the numbers. The player with the higher sum gets the other player’s cards. Players continue to take and add up two cards at a time until no cards are left. The player with more cards is the winner.
  * Low number
    * You can play the same game with subtraction, but it would be called Lower Number. The player with the lower difference (answer) gives his or her cards to the other player. The person with the fewest cards at the end is the winner. You can play the same game with multiplication.
  * Broken calculator
    * Ask your child to pretend that the number 8 key on the calculator is broken. Ask how he or she can make the number 18 appear on the screen without the 8 key. (Sample answers include 20 – 2 and 15 + 3).

  * [Roll the dice to count and move](https://www.weareteachers.com/active-math-games/)

#### Measurement

* Comparison
  * Paired (e.g., big or small)
  * Maxima/minima hunt (e.g., price check)
* Clock
  * Time
  * Time calculation
* Unit Conversion

#### Geometry and Spatial Sense

* Shapes
  * 2D shapes hunt
  * 3D shapes hunt
  * I spy on geometry
    * Play I Spy with your child by asking him or her to guess an object you identify by its shape: “I spy something that is round,” “I spy something that has a cylinder shape.” Make this game more challenging by stating two shapes: “I spy something that is round and has a square on it.”
* Orientation
  * Comparison (e.g., left, right, top,...)
  * [Head out on a plot graph scavenger hunt](https://www.weareteachers.com/active-math-games/)
* Symmetry
  * Symmetry hunt
* Structural Stability
  * Comparison

#### Patterning and Algebra

* Pattern
  * Sound pattern
  * Movement pattern
  * Shape pattern
  * Number pattern
  * Pattern hunt

#### Data Management and Probability

* Data
  * Survey
  * Data hunt
* Management
  * Group objects
  * Sort objects
* Estimation
  * Best guess
    * Try this game during a car ride. Call out events and have your child decide whether it is something that is likely, is not likely or will never happen.
