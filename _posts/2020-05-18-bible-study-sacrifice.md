READ: Genesis 22: 1-18 – The Command to Sacrifice Isaac p. 21-22 in your Bible

God called upon Abraham again and was challenged with the greatest of all sacrifices in this scripture passage. This is part of the reason why Abraham is referred to as the Father of Faith, he was asked by God to make significant changes and sacrifices in his life. Abraham responded to God’s call with “Here I am”. We must ask ourselves, “Can we respond so eagerly to God’s call?”

Look back upon your journey of faith in RCIA and ask yourself: “What did you feel you were called to sacrifice?”… Reflect upon the past many months and write down what you think you were called to sacrifice.

* Why this has to be brutal?

* Reflect upon the past many months and write down what you think you were called to sacrifice.
  * Time to relax
  * Selfish point of view
  
* Can you say this verse with your name instead of Abraham?
  * Yes, here I am.
