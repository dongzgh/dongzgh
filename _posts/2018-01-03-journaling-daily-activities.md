  - Installed fresh `paraview-glance` project without any problem
  - Checked development tools on windows for NodeJS projects (https://github.com/Microsoft/NodeJS-guidelines/blob/master/windows-environment.md#compiling-native-addon-modules)
  - Upgraded `NodeJS`, `npm`, `node-gyp`
  - Installed windows-build-tools
  - Found that `node-gyp` can only be used locally after running the following command: \*`node coinfig set python="C:\Users\dzhao\.windows-build-tools\python27\python.exe"`
  - Found reason why `paraviewweb` requires `canvas`
    *`paraviewweb` package listed inside `package-lock.json` requires `canvas@^1.6.9`
    *this should be resolved with version rollback `"resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/paraviewweb/-/paraviewweb-3.2.2.tgz"` \*`paraviewweb` package dependency listed in `package.json` should also be changed to `"paraviewweb": "3.2.2"`
  - Installed `visualizer` and `paraview-glance`
