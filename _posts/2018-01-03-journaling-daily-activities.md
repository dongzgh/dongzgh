    *`paraviewweb` package listed inside `package-lock.json` requires `canvas@^1.6.9`
    *this should be resolved with version rollback `"resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/paraviewweb/-/paraviewweb-3.2.2.tgz"` \*`paraviewweb` package dependency listed in `package.json` should also be changed to `"paraviewweb": "3.2.2"`
